 (SpamAssassin:)
   - stop running spamassassin/spamd (ie: you don't want it to be running
     during the upgrade)
   - run "sa-learn --rebuild", this will sync your journal.  if you skip
     this step, any data from the journal will be lost when the DB is
     upgraded.

swap:
 [WRITE DOWN BIOS NUMBERS]
 boot from bsd.rd (or cd/floppy)
 swap files (careful with mount point perms)
 installboot

after swap:
 passwd dbs
 aliases, tcp.smtp dbs
 SSL cert
 reload DBs
 DB passwords, incl pma
 mods
 RECONNECT
 packages
 (X - x*.tgz, packages, X link, XF86Config, rc.conf/ttys, sysctl.conf, 
   ldconfig -m, root + user PATHs)
 (SpamAssassin:)
   - run "sa-learn --sync", which will cause the db format to be upgraded.
     if you want to see what is going on, you can add the "-D" option.
   - test the new database by running some sample mails through
     SpamAssassin, and/or at least running "sa-learn --dump" to make sure
     the data looks valid.
   - start running spamassassin/spamd again
 locate db (run /etc/weekly from /)
