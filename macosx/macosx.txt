Homebrew (see unix-common/packages.txt):
  umask 022
  /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
  brew update
  # brew outdated
  for i in $(cat packages.txt | sed 's/ *#.*$//' | grep -v '^$'); do
    brew install "$i"
  done
  brew upgrade
  brew cleanup
  brew doctor
  umask 077

  rest of unix-common

SSH:
  cat >> ~/.ssh/config <<EOF

    UseKeychain yes
EOF
  # consolidate and order config file from most to least specific
  for i in ~/.ssh/*_{dsa,ecdsa,ed25519,rsa}; do
    ssh-add -K "$i"  # absolute path
  done

GPG, option 1 (brew):
  umask 022
  brew install gnupg pinentry-mac
  umask 077
  echo "pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
  echo "pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac" >> \
    ~/.gnupg_pre_2.1/gpg-agent.conf  # (?)
  gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
  follow directions in account-setup.txt
  install GPG Suite, for GUI
    (if desired; updates may will overwrite config files)
    (may not automatically pick up new keys?)
  (put our lines at the top of the config files, with a blank before the suite
    ones?)
GPG, option 2 (suite):
  umask 022
  brew uninstall --force gnupg pinentry
  umask 077
  install GPG Suite
  create a key (use RSA/RSA 4096, no expiration, the same name and email as
    for git, and comment 'HOSTNAME -> GitHub'; see account-setup.txt)
GPG, either way:
  sign something (e.g. 'git -s -u KEY_ID', then mash keys and hit ctrl-d);
    check 'Save in Keychain' (or click 'Always Allow', whichever appears)
  -> System Preferences:
    GPG Suite:
      Settings:
        (Default Key)
  (or if not using GPG suite at all, optionally add "default-key KEY_ID" to
    gpg.conf in both (?) ~/.gnupg and ~/.gnupg_pre_2.1)

# perms, in most cases:
